                        <p>Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Just use the old one inch brush. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Trees grow however makes them happy.</p>

                        <p>It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. You gotta think like a tree. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. You can get away with a lot.</p>

                        <p>You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Fluff that up. With practice comes confidence.</p>

                        <p>From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds.</p>

                        <p>You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Anyone can paint. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>

                        <p>We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Let's have a happy little tree in here. There it is. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look.</p>

                        <p>Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Use what you see, don't plan it. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.</p>

                        <p>This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. In your world you have total and absolute power. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.</p>

Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.</p>

                      <p>In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. You gotta think like a tree. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.</p>

                      <p>Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Just make a decision and let it go. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.</p>
